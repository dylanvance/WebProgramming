        <p> 
            My name is Dylan Vance and I am a senior at UNF. I am going for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
            I graduated high school in 2020 and then begun classes at UNF in the Fall of 2020. <br>
            Initially, I was studying Electrical Engineering, but when I took Programming 1 in my first semester 
            I realized that I had a passion for programming and switched my major to Computer Science. <br>
            I will graduate after this semester and I will be pursuing a career in Software Engineering.
            I am taking Internet Programming because I wanted to learn more programming langauges and how to make a website.

        <p>
            I am a big fan of all sports, but I personally enjoy the NFL, MLB, and NBA the most. I am a huge Jaguars fan as well. 
            I have been to three Jags home games in the past couple of years, and they were all wins! <br>
            For my 21st birthday, I went to the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IGt9ZihUO8&ab_channel=NFL" target="_blank"> Jaguars vs. Ravens game </a>
            and the Jags pulled off a crazy come-from-behind win in the last minute. Later that same season, my family and I got free tickets from <br>
            donating blood at the Jaguars stadium for their 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgNunih29ag&ab_channel=NFL" target="_blank">Week 18 game versus the Titans</a>.
            This game was the last of the 2022 regular season and the winner would win the AFC South Division and earn a playoff spot. <br>
            It was such an intense game and it came down to the wire, but the Jags pulled off a win and I got to see my team win the 
            division for the first time in 5 years in person. It was a very special moment. <br>
            This past season, for my 22nd birthday, I went and saw the 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBnTvOdsHEw&ab_channel=NFL" target="_blank">Jaguars beat up on the Titans</a>, 
            which is always a great thing to see.

            In my free time, I workout at the gym, play video games, and read books. I enjoy lifting weights for bodybuilding at the Student 
            Wellness Complex on UNF's campus because UNF students have free access. <br>
            I am a fan of horror novels and a few I have read recently are 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)" target="_blank">The Exorcist</a> by William Peter Blatty,
